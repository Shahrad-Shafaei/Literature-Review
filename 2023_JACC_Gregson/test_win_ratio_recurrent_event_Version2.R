# Data are simulated for two groups (treatment and control), each with several subjects and multiple recurrent events.
# Each subjectâ€™s primary outcome is the number of events (fewer is better), and the secondary is time to terminal event (longer is better).
# The wr() function from the WR package calculates the Win Ratio: for all possible pairs (one from each group), it counts how often a subject in the treatment group "wins" (has fewer events, or if tied, survives longer) vs. the control group.
# The code prints both the event-level and subject-level data and the Win Ratio results.
# The code assumes Win Ratio is based on:
# Number of recurrent events (lower is better)
# If tied, longer survival/censoring time is better
# Note:
  # Win Ratio is more common for time-to-first-event or composite endpoints, but the above approach adapts it to recurrent events (using total event count as primary outcome), as seen in some recent methodological papers.
  # For more complex recurrent event Win Ratio (e.g., pairwise comparison of each event), more advanced code or packages may be required.
